## Presentation Overview

At the recent [Bangalore Java User Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bangalorejug/)(JUG) Meetup hosted by [Sahaj Software](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sahajsoftware/), I had the unique honor of being the first student presenter. My talk focused on maintaining a robust, secure, and up-to-date codebase, highlighting the importance of proactive dependency management and addressing technical debt using tools like Maven Versions and Enforcer plugins.

### Insights and Learnings

I presented alongside Rajadurai Krishnamoorthy, where we discussed challenges faced when working with legacy versions of frameworks and dependencies, especially in long-term projects like Gurukulams. I shared insights into the mindset shift needed for developers to adopt an “upgrade-by-default” approach, which reduces long-term costs and security risks, much like regular updates we perform on personal devices. I also explained practical techniques for tracking updates and enforcing standards in CI/CD workflows, focusing on cost-effective, continuous upgrades over major disruptive changes.

### Impact and Recognition

This presentation wasn’t just about sharing technical insights—it also marked a significant moment for the Bangalore JUG as a step toward integrating student voices into the professional Java community. The event drew an engaged audience, sparking quality discussions on handling deprecated APIs, upgrade pre-requisites, and best practices. The positive feedback reinforced the value of building a bridge between academic communities and the professional Java world.

### Acknowledgments

Gratitude to the Bangalore JUG for this wonderful opportunity, as well as to Sathish Kumar Thiyagarajan sir and Rajadurai Krishnamoorthy sir. Their support and encouragement provided a platform for my growth and reinforced the role of students in the open-source and Java education ecosystems.
