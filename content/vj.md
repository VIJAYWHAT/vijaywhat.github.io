**Good marning everyone**,

I am vijay raja. open source developer and full Stack developer. 

I thank bangalore jug for giving me this wonderful opportunity to Share my practical experience with you all. whatever that i'm going to talk today is based on my Experience in bbuilding an open source platform call gurukulams.com.

Gurukulam.com is an online education Platform it's build by the students for the students.

being an opensource project. 80% of contribution are come from either people with lessor experience or no experience, in fact majority of out contributor are either teacher or students. This actually demands us to create a code base, That expect a safe and secure platform for everyone to come and contribute. our CI/CD practices has to go through all the quality checks to make sure any contribution that we get is a good quality. 

now let me explain our approach towards the CI/CD pipelines.we actually comes our approach is concerned  about Three major aspects. that is considered for every Contributions.

Firstly, we make would like to sure everyone followed proper coding Standard, we do that through a tool called check style through, and

Secondly, we would like to make sure all of our contribution follows the architectural guidelines that we have setup and we achieve that through a tool call Arc Unit.

And last and the most important one is we would like to make sure our code base is thoroughly tested. We alwats aim for 100% coverage we do this through a tool called jacoco.

All this we expected that, this will give us a better control over our software. 
but wait,
we were in for a suprise with an unexpected challenge.


Now let me explain the project...
