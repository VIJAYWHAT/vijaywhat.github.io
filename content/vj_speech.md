**Good morning everyone**,

This is Vijay Raja. i am an open source and full Stack developer. 

I thank bangalore jug for giving me this wonderful opportunity to Share my practical experience with you. whatever that i'm going to talk today is based on my Experience in building an open source platform called gurukulams.com.

Gurukulam.com is an online education Platform it's built by the students for the students.

being an opensource project. 80% of contribution comes from either people with lesser experience or no experience, infact the majority of our contributor are mostly teacher and students. This actually demands us to create a code base, That expect a safe and secure platform for everyone to come and contribute. our CI/CD practices will go through all the quality checks to make sure the contribution we receive are in good quality. 

now let me explain our approach towards the CI/CD pipelines. our approach is concerned about Three major aspects. that is considered for every Contributions.

Firstly, we make would like to sure everyone followed proper coding Standard, we do that through a tool called check style through, and

Secondly, we would like to make sure all of our contribution follows the architectural guidelines that we have setup and we achieve that through a tool call Arc Unit.

And last and the most important one is we would like to make sure our code base is thoroughly tested. We always aim for 100% coverage we do this through a tool called jacoco.

All this we expected that, this will give us a better control over our software.
but wait,
we were in for a suprise with an unexpected challenge.


Now let me explain the project...
