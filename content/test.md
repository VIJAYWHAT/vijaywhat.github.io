**Good morning everyone,**

I am Vijay Raja. I am an open-source, full-stack developer.

I thank Bangalore JUG for giving me this wonderful opportunity to share my practical experience with you all. What I'm going to talk about is based on my experience building an open-source project called Gurukulams.
