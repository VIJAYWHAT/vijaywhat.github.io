## SQL Components: Complete SQL Powerhouse for Modern Java Development  

SQL Components bridges the gap between powerful SQL operations and scalable Java code. It provides zero-compromise solutions, enabling developers to harness SQL's full potential with type-safe, automated, and efficient persistence tools.  

### Key Features  
- **Unified Persistence:** Combines SQL Mapper flexibility with ORM robustness.  
- **Turbocharged Development:** Automated code generation to reduce manual efforts.  
- **Type Safety:** Compile-time checks for safer and more reliable code.  
- **Simply SQL:** Unleashes SQL power without ORM limitations.  
- **Future-Proof:** Automatically evolves with Java and database updates.  

### My Contributions  
As a contributor to SQL Components, I played a vital role in its development and enhancement:  

1. **Development and R&D:**  
   - Conducted research to improve framework functionality.  
   - Wrote APIs and developed features for enhanced usability.  
   - Worked on FreeMarker Template Language (FTL) files for code generation.  

2. **Bug Tracking and Resolution:**  
   - **Fixed Invalid Insert Query Issue:**  
     Addressed syntax errors in `MyTableStore.java`, ensuring query compatibility.  
   - **Resolved Money Test Error:**  
     Enhanced row mapper logic to handle large numeric values safely.  
   - **Improved JSON Type Mapping:**  
     Ensured JSON objects were accurately mapped, resolving row mapper mismatches.  

3. **Testing and Validation:**  
   - Designed test cases for robust type-safe development.  
   - Validated database operations and framework performance.  

### Learning and Impact  
This project provided invaluable experience in API design, FreeMarker templates, debugging, and Java-based SQL frameworks. My contributions directly improved SQL Components' functionality and developer experience.
