Gurukulams is an open-source initiative dedicated to transforming traditional textbooks into dynamic, **interactive digital resources**. Unlike standard PDFs or other digital material repositories, our platform provides an enriched learning experience through advanced features that go beyond the limitations of physical books.

Currently, our organization offers two types of books: **government school textbooks** and advanced **computer science resources** for college students. The government school books include additional questions for students preparing for competitive exams like NEET and JEE, sourced from discussions with professionals and previous exam questions. For computer science, we provide a comprehensive set of interview preparation questions.

### Technologies Used

- **Content Preparation**: We use **Markdown** and **KaTeX** for content creation, with KaTeX facilitating the inclusion of mathematical formulas. Goat Diagrams are utilized for diagrammatic representations, while Reveal.js is employed to create engaging presentation slides.
- **Version Control and Collaboration**: Our team works with Git, where I serve as the **project coordinator**, implementing **GitOps** practices. We create and use issue templates to assign tasks via GitHub issues, employing branching strategies to manage our workflow. Once work is completed, we open pull requests (**PRs**) for review, allowing team members to comment or merge changes into the main branch.
- **Micro Frontend Architecture**: Our project leverages micro frontend technology, ensuring modular and scalable application development. Each book's content is stored in separate GitHub repositories, and we utilize GitHub pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Content Delivery**: For server-side rendering and viewing changes in real-time, we utilize Hugo, enhancing the user experience and facilitating seamless updates.

By employing the **latest technologies** and nearly all features of **Git**, we simplify communication and project management through the Kanban methodology, ensuring that our collaborative efforts yield a meaningful impact in the educational landscape.
